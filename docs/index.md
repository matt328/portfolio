# About Me

Hi! I'm Matt and I'm a seasoned software engineer with over 15 years of experience developing solutions to complex problems. I've worked with a wide range of tools and technologies with particular interest and experience with C++, Java, Angular, and recently Kubernetes. I am passionate about crafting elegant, scalable, and high performance tools and applications to empower developers and end users to succeed at their jobs.

In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of personal projects that are representative of the quality of work I strive to bring to my professional career. These range from realtime graphics API programming to provisioning a cloud-based application platform using Kubernetes.

I hold a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Pittsburgh and have had the privilege of working with world class organizations like Raytheon and Penn State University.
